# Trabalhos_Cplus_plus
On this repository you'll find some projects I've made using C++

The purpose of the exercises, is written as a comment, either in the beginning of the file, just below the command to include libraries to the file or below the indication of the number of the exercise. On both cases I haven't translated it to English.

Today (08/02) there are only 2 projects, but I'll update the repository as soon as I learn more C++
